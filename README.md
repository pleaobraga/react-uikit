# React UI Kit (Based on Pretine 7)

This project is a **React-based UI Kit** inspired by and adapted from [Pretine 7](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1293978471602433537).  
Pretine 7 was originally created to align with Mantine’s React architecture and provides a robust, themeable design system with light/dark mode support.

The **main goal** of this project is to base **reusable components** on a single design system that anyone can easily integrate into their own project.

I will also be reusing it in my **personal projects** so I don’t have to create components from scratch.  
It is built using **shadcn** and **Tailwind CSS** under the hood, while the **UI design is based on Pretine 7**.

## 🛠️ Key Libraries Used

This project leverages several important libraries and tools:

- **React** – The core library for building user interfaces.
- **shadcn/ui** – Provides accessible, customizable React components.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript** – Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **Vitest** – Fast unit testing framework.
- **ESLint** – Linting tool for code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier** – Code formatter for consistent style.
- **Storybook** – UI component explorer and documentation tool.
